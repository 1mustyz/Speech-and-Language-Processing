# Speech and Language Processing Study Notes

This repository contains my personal study notes and lab implementations for the book **Speech and Language Processing (3rd Edition Draft)** by Daniel Jurafsky and James H. Martin. The materials here are created as part of my learning journey in the "Beginners in Research Driven Studies" (BIRDS) channel of the Cohere Labs Discord AI/ML community.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to document my understanding of the concepts, algorithms, and techniques covered in the book through structured notes and practical implementations. Each chapter folder contains Jupyter notebooks that include detailed notes and corresponding lab exercises to reinforce the theoretical concepts with hands-on practice.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by chapters from the book. Each chapter folder contains two main types of files:

- **Notes** (`chapter-X-note.ipynb`): These notebooks summarize key concepts, explanations, and insights from the corresponding chapter of the book. They serve as a reference for theoretical understanding.
- **Labs** (`chapter-X-lab.ipynb`): These notebooks contain practical implementations of algorithms and techniques discussed in the chapter. The labs are designed to complement the notes by providing hands-on coding exercises.

Current structure:

```text
chapter2/
├── chapter-2-note.ipynb
├── chapter-2-lab.ipynb
chapter3/
├── chapter-3-note.ipynb
├── chapter-3-lab.ipynb
```

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Read the Book**: The notes and labs are designed to be used alongside the _Speech and Language Processing (3rd Edition Draft)_ book, available at https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/. The official book draft provides the primary content and detailed explanations.

2. **Study the Notes**: Start with the `chapter-X-note.ipynb` file for a given chapter to review summarized concepts and key takeaways.

3. **Work Through the Labs**: Use the `chapter-X-lab.ipynb` file to explore practical implementations of the algorithms and techniques discussed in the chapter. These labs are meant to deepen understanding through coding.

4. **Cross-Reference**: The notes and labs are complementary. The labs often include additional explanations or context for the concepts covered in the notes, so it's recommended to review them together.
